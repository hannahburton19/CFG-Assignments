# Recipe Manager API

This API allows users to create, save and modify their favourite recipes to be able to retrieve again at a later date. The database stores information such as the recipe name, ingredients list (including quantities required) and instructions for how to make the dish. Features of the API include:
- adding a new user (the API allows multiple users)
- adding a new recipe
- adding ingredients to a recipe
- searching for a saved recipe
- retrieving the ingredients list for a saved recipe
- updating the instructions for a saved recipe
- deleting a recipe


## Set-up Guide

Before running the code, you will need to make sure that you have Node.js and npm (Node package manager) installed on your machine first. 

Then you will need to initialise a new Node.js project. To do this, create an empty project folder and navigate to it using the terminal. Then run `npm init -y` which will initialise a new Node.js project by creating a basic package.json file. 

You will then need to install the following packages within the project using Node package manager (npm):

1. Express (`npm install express`) - this is a web application framework for Node.js
2. mysql2 (`npm install mysql2`) - this allows you to connect to your SQL database
3. body-parser (`npm install body-parser`) - this is an Express middleware that parses incoming JSON bodies as part of HTTP requests
4. dotenv (`npm install dotenv`) - this is a package used to load enviroment variables from your .env file into your application (see below for more details)

Once installed correctly, the above packages should appear as 'dependencies' in your package.json file.

You will also need to create a .env file where you will store any environment variables that contain sensitive information. In this case, the .env file should contain your host, database username, database password and database name. These should be entered in the following format:

DB_HOST=your_host
DB_USER=your_username
DB_PASSWORD=your_password
DB_DATABASE=your_database_name

Before running the JS ('index.js') and SQL ('recipes.sql) code, you will need to add the following line to the "scripts" object in your package.json file:
`"start": "node src/index.js"`. -- in this case, the .js and .sql files are saved in a folder named 'src'.

Finally, to start the server running, you will need to run `npm start` in the terminal.
