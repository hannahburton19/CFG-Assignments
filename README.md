# CFG-Assignments :star_struck:

## Welcome to my git & github assignment!

### Creating a _JavaScript_ :heart_eyes: file and commiting to my local repo, checking the `git status` as I go along:

### Pushing the new .js[^1] file to my remote repo:

[^1]: **I wanted to practice what we learnt in the first JavaScript session**

### Creating a new branch to make a change to my .js file, pushing it to remote repo and adding a new .txt file 
> [!NOTE]
> I also pushed this to the remote repo, **not included in screenshot**

### Opening a pull request to merge the changes from Branch1 into main:

![pull request merged screenshot 3](https://github.com/hannahburton19/CFG-Assignments/blob/main/Pull%20request%20merged.png?raw=true)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> I have added a .gitignore file to my repo - this is a file that lists all of the file types that I want other people to ignore when I share my repo with them (in this case, I've asked that all .png files be ignored as they're screenshots for this assignment!)

- [x] create requirements.txt file
- [x] briefly explain what it's used for (it's to list all the dependencies that a Python project will need, so that others can run your code correctly)
- [ ] learn Python
